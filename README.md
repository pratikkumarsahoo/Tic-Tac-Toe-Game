# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple two-player console-based game developed in Java. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3×3 grid with their respective symbols — ‘X’ and ‘O’. The objective of the game is to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal before the opponent does.
